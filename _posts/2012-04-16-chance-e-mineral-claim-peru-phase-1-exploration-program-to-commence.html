<p style="text-align: right;">News Release 2012-02</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">April 16, 2012</p>
<p><strong>Vancouver, B.C. April 16, 2012   </strong> Lori McClenahan, President and Chief Executive Officer, Intigold Mines Ltd. (<a href="http://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IGD.V">IGD:V</a>) and St. Elias Mines Ltd. (<a href="http://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SLI.V">SLI:V</a>) announces today exploration on the Chance E mineral concession (the “Chance E Claim”) which adjoins St. Elias’ wholly-owned Tesoro Gold Project located in south-western Peru will be commencing in the upcoming weeks.</p>
<p>Exploration work consisting of geological mapping and sampling, satellite imagery, as well as control grid emplacement will be commencing in the upcoming weeks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Chance E Claim</em></strong></p>
<p>The Chance E Claim is a strategic claim that adjoins the southern end of the Tesoro Gold Project where St. Elias is currently drilling to delineate gold resources.  Geological information, together with <a href="http://www.quantecgeoscience.com/technology/titan-24-benefits">Titan 24 geophysical data</a> and satellite imagery, confirms that structural lineaments which are coincident with gold mineralization on Tesoro Project extend onto the Chance E Claim.</p>
<p>The initial exploration program on the Chance E Claim will consist of, but is not limited to, the interpretation of satellite imagery acquired to exact specifications and geological mapping and sampling. The program is scheduled to commence immediately.</p>
<p><a href="http://intigold.com/">IntiGold</a> can acquire a 60% interest in the Chance E Claim (subject to a 1.5% NSR) in consideration of making cash payments of $500,000 to St. Elias, issuing 1,000,000 common shares in the capital of IntiGold to St. Elias and incurring $1,000,000 in exploration expenditures on the property over a three-year period.</p>
<p>IntiGold’s first year commitment under the option agreement is to pay $25,000 to St. Elias and incur $200,000 in exploration expenditures on the property.</p>
<p>“The board of directors of Intigold and St. Elias are excited to be initiating the exploration of  the Chance E claim which is on strike to the numerous gold bearing veins occurring on the adjoining <a href="http://steliasmines.com/projects/peru-projects/tesoro-peru/">Tesoro Property</a>.” states Lori McClenahan, President and Chief Executive Officer.</p>
