<p style="text-align: right;">News Release 2012-13<br />
July 16, 2012</p>
<p><strong>Vancouver, BC, July 16, 2012</strong>, Lori McClenahan, President of Intigold Mines Ltd. (the “Company”), announces today that the Company has initiated the process for listing its shares on the <a href="http://www.otcqx.com/qx/home">OTC QX</a> in the United States.</p>
<p>The Company has retained the financial consultant firm of <a href="http://www.baxtercap.com/BaxterCap.com/Home.html">Baxter Capital Advisors</a>, Inc. to pursue a listing on the OTC QX. The Company currently trades on the TSX Venture Exchange under the ticker symbol “<a href="http://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IGD.V">IGD</a>” and a dual listing on the OTC QX would broaden the market to include investors in the United States.</p>
<p>Reserved for international companies listed on a qualified stock exchange in their home country, the OTC QX provides easy access to U.S. investors and the ability for a company to diversify its shareholder base. “We are very pleased to be working toward providing our U.S. investors with an alternative trading platform for our common shares and believe this is an important step toward increasing Intigold’s visibility within the U.S. market” states Lori McClenahan, President of the Company.</p>
<p><strong>About the OTC QX</strong></p>
<p>The OCT QX is the premier tier of the U.S. Over-the-Counter (“OTC”) marketplace which gives non- U.S. companies access to U.S. investors, without the duplicative regulatory costs required of listing on a traditional U.S. exchange. The innovative OTC QX platform offers companies and their shareholders a level of marketplace services formerly available only on a U.S. exchange. The OTC QX provides the highest level of visibility and access to U.S. investors possible in the OTC market.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.otcqx.com/qx/home">OTC QX</a> is fully electronic and gives investors access through all major online and full-service brokerage firms in the U.S., including <a href="https://www.schwab.com/">Schwab</a>, <a href="https://us.etrade.com/home">E*Trade</a>, <a href="http://www.scottrade.com/">Scottrade</a>, <a href="https://www.tdameritrade.com/welcome1.html">TD Ameritrade</a> and <a href="http://www.fidelity.ca/">Fidelity</a>. Trades are settled and cleared in the U.S. similar to any <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/">NASDAQ</a> or <a href="http://www.nyse.com/">NYSE</a> stock, and trade reports are disseminated through <a href="http://ca.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a>,<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="http://ca.reuters.com/">Reuters</a> and most other financial data providers.</p>
