<p style="text-align: right;">News Release 2012-16</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">August 16, 2012</p>
<p><strong>VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Aug. 16, 2012</strong> /PRNewswire/ – Lori McClenahan, President of Intigold Mines Ltd. (the “Company”), announces that TTAGIT Social Networks Inc. (“TTAGIT”) has launched its proprietary social networking application and website.  The Company owns a 51% interest in TTAGIT.</p>
<p>TTAGIT<strong>,</strong> the first open-forum discussion social network and comment management system that allows users to comment on all URLs with one login, will be available in beta form for free download and use.  TTAGIT is a social networking application and website where members can engage in conversations and participate in debates on sites and portals that currently do not allow live streaming.</p>
<p>Despite all of the social media platforms available, TTAGIT recognized that none allowed for a streamlined conversation online without needless integration.  Contrary to most social media sites, TTAGIT is an open forum that is not limited to just the people you know or “follow.”  Enabling the TTAGIT extension on the Google Chrome browser allows users to see the entire thread of conversation for that particular site or article.</p>
<p>“It was apparent that the Internet was missing a tool that simplified the way we comment and communicate online,” said Lori McClenahan, President of Intigold Mines Ltd. “TTAGIT is going to fill this void for the every-day Internet user and, after lengths of perfecting and developing this network, we are thrilled to share it with the public.”</p>
<p>TTAGIT uses a rewards system to encourage users to participate in a game that is unique to a social networking experience.  It accumulates statistics on each profile based on commenting and the replies to each post.  Members who receive rewards and hidden Easter eggs based on their achievements can spend their points on ads or hijacking finds.  TTAGIT allows you to <em>Put Your Mark on Everything</em>©.</p>
<p><strong>TTAGIT users can:</strong></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Streamline social media discussions</li>
<li>Format each individual post with the option to bold, italicize and hyperlink</li>
<li>Collect followers to share ideas</li>
<li>See what is trending and where the leading conversations are</li>
<li>Place ads into discussion streams with built in analytics</li>
<li>Collect achievement badges through daily habits</li>
</ul>
<p>TTAGIT technologies are geared toward the rising mobility use and the upcoming Internet TV.  There is also an advertising model built in to TTAGIT that lets advertisers post within a related comment feed.  TTAGIT is a mobile application and website that will be a valuable tool for reporters, politicians, comedians and the general public.</p>
