<p align="center"><strong>Intigold Mines Ltd. - TTAGIT Launches Android Application</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vancouver, BC, September 21, 2012, </strong>Lori McClenahan, President of Intigold Mines Ltd. (the “Company”), announces that TTAGIT Social Networks Inc. ("TTAGIT") has launched in beta its proprietary application for Android users.  The Company owns a 51% interest in TTAGIT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TTAGIT, the first open-forum discussion social network and comment management system that allows users to comment on all URLs with one login, will launch in beta form for Android users in the Google Play store.  TTAGIT is a social networking tool where members can engage in conversations and participate in debates on sites and portals that currently do not allow live streaming and is now available to people on the move, with the expansion of the mobile application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite all of the social media platforms available, the creators of TTAGIT recognized that none allowed for a streamlined conversation online without needless integration.  Contrary to most social media sites, TTAGIT is an open forum that is not limited to just the people you know or “follow.”  Enabling the TTAGIT extension on the Google Chrome browser and downloading the app allows users to see the entire thread of conversation for that particular site or article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to make TTAGIT even more accessible to the public with the launch of the Android cell phone application,” said Lori McClenahan, President of Intigold Mines Ltd. “TTAGIT is going to fill a void for the every-day Internet and app user and, after lengths of developing, we are happy to expand into the mobile sector.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TTAGIT uses a rewards system to encourage users to participate in a game that is unique to a social networking experience. It accumulates statistics on each profile based on commenting and the replies to each post.  Members who receive rewards and hidden Easter eggs based on their achievements can spend their points on ads or hijacking finds.  TTAGIT allows you to <em>Put Your Mark on Everything</em>©.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TTAGIT users can:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Streamline social media discussions</li>
<li>Format each individual post with the option to bold, italicize and hyperlink</li>
<li>Collect followers to share ideas</li>
<li>See what is trending and where the leading conversations are
<ul>
<li>Place ads into discussion streams with built in analytics</li>
<li>Collect achievement badges through daily habits</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Developed and owned 51% by Intigold Mines Ltd., TTAGIT technologies are geared toward the rising mobility use and the upcoming Internet TV.  There is also a model built in to TTAGIT that lets advertisers post within a related comment feed.  TTAGIT is a mobile application and website that will be a valuable tool for reporters, politicians, comedians and the general public.</p>
