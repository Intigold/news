<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NEWS RELEASE</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Intigold Mines Ltd. - TTAGIT Strategic Alliance with KRED</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong></strong><strong>Vancouver, BC, October 5, 2012,</strong> Lori McClenahan, President of Intigold Mines Ltd. (the “Company”), announces that TTAGIT Social Networks Inc. ("TTAGIT") has formed a strategic alliance partnership with KRED. The Company owns a 51% interest in TTAGIT.</p>
<p>KRED Influence Measurement, or KRED, is a measure of influence created by PeopleBrowsr, a San Francisco based social media analytics company, to identify influential people in interest-based communities. KRED scores are generated by observing a social network user’s content, who it reaches, who acts upon it, and whether the user relays the content of others. Developed on the principle that ‘We all have Influence Somewhere, KRED delivers overall network scores as well as unique scores within each of a user’s communities.</p>
<p>By TTAGIT aligning with KRED, the goal is to build a user base targeted at NFL fans who wish to build influence in the social network arena. The partnership with KRED also comes with the launch of TTAGIT Hubs which act as groups for users to gather in similar categories. The NFL Hubs will demonstrate how users can create Hubs in any category they wish and post as those Hubs on any URL using the browser extensions. Hub leaders can choose to accept requests from users to join the Hubs and post with 1500 characters as opposed to the standard 500 characters.</p>
<p>TTAGIT is an open forum discussion social network that manages commenting across the Internet and allows users to comment on any URL without multiple logins using a Chrome browser extension. TTAGIT has a Chrome extension, an Android application and also works on Google TV</p>
<p>Twitter retweets, mentions and replies are included in everyone's score. Visitors to KRED.com may also opt to include Facebook interactions in their score.</p>
<p>Users may give KRED to anyone that they feel is deserving of extra recognitions for the influence in a community.</p>
<p>KRED is the only social influence metric to include points accrued for 'real-world' accomplishments, known as 'KRED Moments.</p>
<p>Powering KRED Story is KRED’s access to the Twitter firehose that lets it mine any and all tweets in real time. “The next version of KRED takes it beyond being just a number,” said KRED CEO Andrew Grill, who described KRED story as a user’s “visual stream of influence.”</p>
<p>Developed and owned 51% by Intigold Mines Ltd., TTAGIT technologies are geared toward the rising mobility use and the upcoming Internet TV.  There is also a model built in to TTAGIT that lets advertisers post within a related comment feed.  TTAGIT is a mobile application and website that will be a valuable tool for reporters, politicians, comedians and the general public.</p>
