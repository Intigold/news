<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong>Vancouver, BC November 1, 2012, </strong>Lori McClenahan, President and CEO of Intigold Mines Ltd. (“the “Company”), announces that the Company wishes to retract and clarify certain disclosures made in its news releases dated August 16/12, August 31/12, September 21/12 and October 5/12.  The Company does not currently own a 51% interest in TTAGIT Social Networks Inc. (“TTAGIT”).  The Company has not finalized and executed a definitive agreement with TTAGIT and has not received final approval from TSX Venture Exchange.</p>
<p> The TSX Venture Exchange conditional acceptance was received on June 12, 2012 subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p>1.         the Company filing a filing statement with the Exchange with respect to the Transaction;</p>
<p>2.         the Company providing audited financial statements of TTAGIT (to be incorporated into the filing statement referred to under item 1);</p>
<p>3.         the Company providing a Business Plan of TTAGIT (to be incorporated into the filing statement referred to under item 1);</p>
<p>4.         the Company providing an updated copy of the principal agreement governing the Transaction to the Exchange; and</p>
<p>5.         shareholder approval of the Transaction.</p>
<p> To date, the Company has not met the conditional acceptance conditions and has received written notice from the Exchange to meet these conditions by November 14, 2012 otherwise conditional acceptance will be withdrawn.</p>
<p> The Company is currently in the process of gathering the material and information required to meet the Exchange’s conditions for conditional acceptance.  If the Company is unable to meet all of the conditions for conditional acceptance by November 14, 2012, the Company intends to apply for an extension of the deadline.  There can be no assurance that such extension will be granted.</p>
