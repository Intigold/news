<p><strong>Vancouver, B.C. November 7, 2012</strong> Intigold Mines Ltd. (“Intigold” or the “Company”) announces that the Company will hold its 2012 Annual General and Special Meeting (the “Meeting”) in Vancouver, BC, as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Meeting Date:</strong>                      Thursday, December 20, 2012</p>

<p><strong>Record Date:                       </strong>Tuesday, November 13, 2012<strong></strong></p>
<p>The Company also announces the approval by its Board of Directors on November 7, 2012 of an advance notice policy (the "Policy") regarding meetings of shareholders. The Policy, among other things, includes a provision that requires advance notice to the Company in certain circumstances where shareholders of the Company nominate persons for election to the Board.</p>
<p>The Policy establishes deadlines by which holders of record of common shares of the Company must submit director nominations to the Company prior to any annual or special meeting of shareholders. The Policy also sets forth certain information that a shareholder must include in the notice to the Company for the notice to be accepted.</p>
<p>The deadline for notice to the Company in the case of an annual meeting of shareholders is not less than 30 nor more than 65 days prior to the date of the annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is to be held on a date that is less than 50 days after the date on which the first public announcement of the date of the annual meeting was made, notice may be made not later than the close of business on the 10th day following such public announcement.</p>
<p>The deadline for notice to the Company in the case of a special meeting of shareholders (which is not also an annual meeting), is not later than the close of business on the 15th day following the day on which the first public announcement of the date of the special meeting was made.</p>
<p>The Policy is effective as of the date it was approved.</p>
