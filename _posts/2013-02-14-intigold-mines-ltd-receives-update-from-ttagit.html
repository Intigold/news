<p align="center"><strong>Intigold Mines Ltd. Receives Update From TTAGIT</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong> </strong><strong>Vancouver, BC, February 14, 2013, </strong>Lori McClenahan, President of Intigold Mines Ltd. (the “Company”), announces today that the Company has received the following update from TTAGIT Social Networks Inc. (“TTAGIT”).  The Company owns a 51% interest in TTAGIT.</p>
<p>“<strong>TTAGIT Works on Architecture of the Site and Plans the iPhone Build</strong></p>
<p>TTAGIT has been working on the Architecture of both the front end and the back end of the website as well as planning a build for the iphone. To allow for a faster mobile application TTAGIT needs to do some clean up to the architecture on the back end. At the same time some clean up on the front end is necessary to stay on top of current technologies.</p>
<p>To achieve this we are implementing Redis on the back end, which is an open source, advanced key-value store and working with Node.js a platform built on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/" target="_blank">Chrome's JavaScript runtime</a> for easily building fast, scalable network applications to build in real time. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.</p>
<p>On the front end we will be using Twitter’s Bootstrap Framework to clean things up and allow for easier scaling with HTML5, CSS and Javascript. Bootstrap is a front-end toolkit for rapidly developing web applications. It is a collection of CSS and HTML conventions. It uses some of the latest browser techniques to provide you with stylish typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation.</p>
<p>Some of the changes TTAGIT will be making will be combining the username and full name into one user name which allows for spaces and multiples of the same name. This is where Redis comes in, by using unique ID’s will allow us to separate usernames from the actual user and store multiples of the same user name without having to block users from using their own names as user names because it is already taken. This allows the system to have several ‘John Doe’s’ without affecting the database.</p>
<p>We are also introducing the ability to re-post and to share posts via Twitter, Facebook and Google+. Also we are implementing some context into posts that have been made by our extensions over URL’s by scraping the original article through RSS feeds and posting them back with the original comment a user clicks on.</p>
<p>The biggest thing that we are working towards is being responsive and asynchronous. This means that the application will view the same on multiple screen sizes and devices. Also uploaded will happen in real time asynchronous by allowing the back end to work while the front end delivers the post.</p>
<p>We are working toward more mobility by introducing our iphone application with all the new features and catching our Android application up to speed. Some more applications for mobile are in the works that run on the TTAGIT engine, stay tuned for more news to come.”</p>
