<p><strong>Vancouver, BC, February 28, 2013, </strong>Lori McClenahan, President of Intigold Mines Ltd. (the “Company”), announces today that the Company has received the following update from TTAGIT Social Networks Inc. (“TTAGIT”).  The Company owns a 51% interest in TTAGIT.</p>
<p> “<strong>TTAGIT Social Networks Inc. Taps Global Branding/Marketing Firm, Tenner And Associates, Inc to Roll Out Social Media Promotions</strong>.</p>
<p> Las Vegas, NV -  TTAGIT, an Open Forum Discussion Social Network and Comment Management System, is poised for significant growth.  To assure that its highly original content, which will include contests and promotions for its users, gains maximum visibility and traction, TTAGIT has hired Lisa Tenner and her experienced, “out of the box thinking” team to position its brand and products in powerful ways.   From high school students to senior citizens, anyone who wants to comment unmoderated over any URL (by computer or mobile platform), will be able to do so with TTAGITs proven technology.  Tenner has previously worked with TTAGIT in securing Jeremy Ausmus, a Final Table star at last year’s World Series of Poker, for its poker Hub.  Jeremy’s star power significantly elevated the Hub’s cachet and popularity.</p>
<p> Tenner is known for engaging online audiences to move forward with technology that can enhance their online experiences and communications.  Tenner, called a visionary by her peers, considers the TTAGIT model the most sophisticated and in-demand platform moving forward in communications that builds communities.  "I am thrilled to be a part of this team”, remarked Tenner "and look forward to introducing TTAGIT’s future programs to an increasingly wider audience."</p>
