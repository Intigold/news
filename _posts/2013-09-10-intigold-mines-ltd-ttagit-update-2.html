<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NEWS RELEASE</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Intigold Mines Ltd. - TTAGIT Update</strong></p>
<p><b>Vancouver, BC, September 10, 2013</b>, Intigold Mines Ltd. (IGD - TSX.V and IDMNF - OTC QX) has received the following update from TTAGIT Social Networks Inc. ("TTAGIT"). Intigold owns a 51% interest in TTAGIT.</p>
<p>"TTAGIT is architecting an API which will complement its patent-pending revolutionary technology which will work in pulling all tweets from any URL whether they be shortened or not. This will allow users to see all tweets connected with a URL (web page). When a user opens the TTAGIT extension over a web page, if there has been any tweets of that URL, it will show in the feed. This will add content to TTAGIT's streams and show what people are talking about on URL's from Twitter thus helping to populate TTAGIT. This move is a start to bringing social networks into TTAGIT's architecture in order to interact with content relevant to a URL (web page). Users would then be able to respond back which would also tweet the response as an @Reply on Twitter. TTAGIT is also working on utilizing Twitter's card option which let's users attach a video, photo, gallery or a product description to a tweet. TTAGIT is also working on architecture that will allow users to interact more with Twitter from within TTAGIT, like the use of #Hashtags and @Replies within TTAGIT. "The company is very pleased with the current progression of TTAGIT and the upcoming development of Phat Pen (TTAGIT's Financial Application) and looks forward to implementing these changes to increase content over URL's using TTAGIT's engine" stated Leigh Akin , Creative Director of TTAGIT."</p>
