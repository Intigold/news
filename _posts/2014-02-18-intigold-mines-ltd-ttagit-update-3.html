<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NEWS RELEASE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Intigold Mines Ltd. - TTAGIT Update</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vancouver, BC, February 17, 2014</strong>, Intigold Mines Ltd. (<a href="http://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IGD.V">IGD - TSX.V</a>) has received the following update from TTAGIT Social Networks Inc. ("TTAGIT"). Intigold owns a 51% interest in TTAGIT.</p>
<p>"TTAGIT Update</p>
<p>TTAGIT has been working on the new release of TTAGIT production. We have moved our test server from a dedicated server to the cloud for consistency between our cloud server and test server. We intend on adding Twitter to our commenting system and replacing the social network with Twitters for more content on URL's.</p>
<p>TTAGIT has gone with a more modern way of handling real time and we are using faster frameworks to take out any lag in time. TTAGIT also has made our new system more portable to other platforms by using cross platform frameworks in building, which saves on time and allows for a more fluid approach with multi-platforms.</p>
<p>In addition, we realize that we are able to monetize and build out TTAGIT by adding several applications to increase users by picking out markets independently. These will include Phatpen, which is a financial application that allows users to make stock trades from their browser extensions using TTAGIT as a bullboard.</p>
<p>At TTAGIT we have also architected a peer 2-peer ticket sales application that works for mobile phones. Allowing users to buy and sell tickets for events they want to host, this is usable for events like music, plays, food shows or anything you can imagine really. We are also working on a mason style poster wall where event creators can post event posters. The application is called de2our.</p>
<p>As well as a peer 2 peer ticket sales we have also architected a chat room service using TTAGIT's engine for group chatting, sort of like a flirt applications where users can talk in private rooms, the application is called TEZE.</p>
<p>All applications are built on the TTAGIT framework.</p>
<p>We shall be announcing the New TTAGIT shortly and emailing everyone who has already signed up to TTAGIT to notify them of the changes in the new system. "</p>
