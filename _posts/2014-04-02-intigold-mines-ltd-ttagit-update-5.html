<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NEWS RELEASE</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / April 2, 2014 / </strong>Intigold Mines Ltd. (IGD - TSX-V) has received the following update from TTAGIT Social Networks Inc. ("TTAGIT"). Intigold owns a 51% interest in TTAGIT.</p>
<p><strong>TTAGIT - de2our - Update on Business Plan</strong></p>
<p>TTAGIT has further advanced its business plan for de2our. De2our is a mobile application which allows peer-to-peer ticket sales for any event, large or small. The focus is on making selling tickets as easy as possible.</p>
<p>De2our plans to do with ticket sales what Groupon has done for coupons, that is, to allow the common user to create and sell tickets for events with simplicity and low cost. De2our will make peer-to-peer ticket sales easy and will use a smart activity stream that is customized to the user to bring events that are relative to every user's experience.</p>
<p>The main focus is on the ability to scale from smaller events to very large events. We accommodate this by allowing ticket sales directly from the mobile device and allow bar codes for scanning much larger events from a scanning gun.</p>
<p>De2our will take a percentage of the ticket sales, and will hold funds sold until an expired date where ticket sales stop. Once revenue is proven, then marketing becomes much simpler as raising more money for marketing increases the sales that are generated. The room for growth in on-line ticket sales is growing by the day.</p>
<p>De2our will also be a mobile application that will showcase TTAGIT's new commenting system which is made to be built into other products as a commenting tool using Twitter as a social network and a way to categorize topics.</p>
<p>Our main focus is to increase revenue with an application that not only generates income but also can scale limitlessly. We think de2our is our best bet for revenue building and, amongst many other ideas, have chosen to go this route due to its ability to showcase TTAGIT but also to gain widespread interest as it has already generated interest amongst many people within the market.</p>
<p>We look forward to bringing you more and are ready to produce some splash pages shortly where you can register to be on our mailing list for launch dates."</p>
