<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vancouver, BC,  June 23, 2014,  </span>Intigold Mines Ltd. (<a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IGD.V">IGD - TSX-V</a>) announced today that it has recieved the following update from TTAGIT Social Networks Inc. ("<a href="https://ttagit.com">TTAGIT</a>"). Intigold owns a 51% interest in TTAGIT.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #222222;">TTAGIT Development Plan - Stage 1 Update</span></p>

<p>The development team has been hard at work carrying out Stage 1 of TTAGIT's development plan. Stage 1 has been designed to bring the Twitter API (Application Programming Interface) into TTAGIT's technology. In just 14 days, we have completed the main logic of Stage 1 of this plan which is pulling tweets that are relative to a URL down to the permalink. In addition, we discovered an unexpected bonus. The development team found that we could pull the information that the tweet was made from directly from the source (i.e. Twitter, Tweetdeck, Hootsuite, etc.) as opposed to pulling it from the TTAGIT system.</p>

<p>The development team is in the process of completing Stage 1 of the development plan and upon completion, we will issue a further update.</p>

<p>TTAGIT is a proprietary technology which allows you to comment, talk and respond over any website (URL) using live feed while you are viewing the page without having to leave the page that you are on and go to a different website to view or post comments. This is what gives TTAGIT a competitive advantage.</p>
