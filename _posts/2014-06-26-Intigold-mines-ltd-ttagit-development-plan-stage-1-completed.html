<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vancouver, BC,  June 26, 2014,  </span>Intigold Mines Ltd. (<a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IGD.V">IGD - TSX-V</a>) announced today that it has recieved the following update from TTAGIT Social Networks Inc. ("<a href="https://ttagit.com">TTAGIT</a>"). Intigold owns a 51% interest in TTAGIT.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #222222;">TTAGIT Development Plan - Stage 1 Completed</span></p>

<p>TTAGIT has completed stage 1 of its development plan as announced on June 12, 2014 and the new TTAGIT Chrome extension is ready for use and available from the <a style="color: #324fe1;" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ttagit/ijabkockaflfmmcfcpfacclaagfiippe" rel="nofollow" data-rapid_p="10">Google Chrome store</a></p>

<p>We have added the Twitter functionality to the TTAGIT technology which now allows users to comment using Twitter relevant to any URL you are on. You can follow, reply, retweet or favourite any tweet you like and join in on conversations that use Twitter's functionality for notifications and SMS messaging.</p>

<p>TTAGIT is now a commenting system using Twitter that puts semantic information onto any link that a discussion was held over. We not only want to see more people using Twitter because of it but also add more semantics about a URL tweeted such as what people think about it and what is their own opinion on the subject.</p>

<p>We are now moving into Stage 2 of the development plan, the particulars of which will be announced shortly.</p>

<p>TTAGIT is a proprietary technology which allows you to comment, talk and respond over any website (URL) using live feed while you are viewing the page without having to leave the page that you are on and go to a different website to view or post comments. This is what gives TTAGIT a competitive advantage.</p>
