<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NEWS RELEASE</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vancouver, BC, January 27, 2015, </span>Intigold Mines Ltd.(<a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IGD.V">IGD - TSX-V</a>) announced today that it has received the following update from TTAGIT Social Networks Inc. ("TTAGIT"). Intigold owns a 51% interest in TTAGIT.</p>

<p><strong><em>TTAGIT - Development Plan - Progress</em></strong></p>

<p>TTAGIT is continuing with its development plan as previously announced. The development plan has been designed to enhance, advance and monetize the TTAGIT technology.</p>

<p>During 2014, TTAGIT completed Stage 1 of its development plan to bring the Twitter API (Application Programming Interface) into TTAGIT's technology. With this Twitter functionality you can follow, reply, retweet and join in conversations that use Twitter for notifications and SMS messaging. In addition, the TTAGIT technology pulls the information from which the tweet was made directly from the source (i.e. Twitter, Tweetdeck, Hootsuite, etc.) as opposed to pulling it from the TTAGIT system. TTAGIT is now a commenting system using Twitter that puts semantic information onto any link that a discussion was held over.</p>

<p>The new TTAGIT Chrome extension is available from the Google Chrome store at <a style="color: #324fe1;" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ttagit/ijabkockaflfmmcfcpfacclaagfiippe" rel="nofollow" data-rapid_p="10">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ttagit/ijabkockaflfmmcfcpfacclaagfiippe</a>
	
<p><strong><em>TTAGIT - Development Plan Continues with PhatPen</em></strong></p>

<p>PhatPen is an online trading application in development that is being built over top of the TTAGIT engine. It is being designed specifically for use by the financial industry and will allow users to make stock trades while reading a relevant news release or article without having to leave that news release or article (web page). With Phatpen you will be able to connect to an online brokerage account to make web surfing and trading seamless. In addition, with TTAGIT as a tab, it will use Twitter's tweets relevant with that URL (web page) to make a bullboard to comment or post to, as well as, pull tweets from that link.</p>

<p>TTAGIT is moving forward with the development of PhatPen and a mobile solution. We have built the application modular so we can save on development time and be ready for any platform. There is some wait as it will take some time for the application to be approved by the Apple store.</p>

<p>TTAGIT's next move is to pull into production and set the stage for PhatPen and the monetization solution. While we are waiting for approval, we will be putting the PhatPen pitch up on <a style="color: #324fe1;" href="https://phatpen.com" rel="nofollow" data-rapid_p="10">Phatpen.com</a>.</P>
