<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NEWS RELEASE</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vancouver, BC, March 10, 2015, </span>Intigold Mines Ltd.(<a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IGD.V">IGD - TSX-V</a>) announced today that it has received the following update from TTAGIT Social Networks Inc. ("TTAGIT"). Intigold owns a 51% interest in TTAGIT.</p>

<p><strong><em>TTAGIT - Apple Development</em></strong></p>

<p>TTAGIT announces an industry first third party development of an Apple IOS8 Action Extension. Currently the application has been approved and is operational in the Apple Store at the testing stage. It is fully functional on both the iphone and the ipad, and the development team is finalizing minor aesthetics, bug fixes and user interface improvements. With the completion of the refinement stage the product will be ready for public download in the Apple store.</p>

<p>The new TTAGIT application works across all IOS8 devices and allows the application to work on mobile by accessing the action extension on the share button on your iphone or ipad. Currently, TTAGIT scrapes internet content through Twitter for information that can be interacted with in real-time without the need to switch back-and-forth with other applications.</p>

<p>The application is built with Apple's new Swift language. Swift is an innovative new programming language for iOS and OS X with concise yet expressive syntax, producing lightning-fast apps.</p>
	
<p><strong><em>TTAGIT - Phatpen</em></strong></p>

<p>With the proven concept on mobile, the company is looking to move forward with its sister application, Phatpen, which will utilize the TTAGIT technology to talk to APIs from brokerage firms (rather than Twitter). Phatpen will allow users the ability to pull essential information from the brokerage feeds and make trades without leaving the application.</p>

<p>PhatPen is an online trading application under development that is being built over top of the TTAGIT engine. It is being designed specifically for use by the financial industry and will allow users to make stock trades while reading a relevant news release or article without having to leave that news release or article (web page). With Phatpen you will be able to connect to an online brokerage account to make web surfing and trading seamless. In addition, with TTAGIT as a tab, it will use Twitter's tweets relevant with that URL (web page) to make a bullboard to comment or post to, as well as, pull tweets from that link.</p>
	
<p><strong><em>TTAGIT Technology</em></strong></p>

<p>TTAGIT is a proprietary technology which allows you to comment, talk and respond over any website (URL) using live feed while you are viewing the page without having to leave the page that you are on and go to a different website to view or post comments. This is what gives TTAGIT a competitive advantage.</p>
