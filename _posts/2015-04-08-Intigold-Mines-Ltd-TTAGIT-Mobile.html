<p><strong><em>TTAGIT - Update</em></strong></p>

<p>TTAGIT has pulled out of Beta and into production with the <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> powered extension set. TTAGIT has released a mobile Action Extension on <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/ios/">IOS8 Apple Mobile</a> devices that works with ipad, ipod and iphone 5 and 6. TTAGIT also has the Chrome Classic as well as Safari which we have added for desktops.</p>

<p>TTAGIT has released a new website that is 100% Twitter Bootstrap to keep in relevance to our use of Twitter as a Mashup. The new website keeps simplicity and is responsive for Mobile use.</p>

<p>The new action extension lets users interact with Twitter through the share function built right into Apple's IOS system for a more user-friendly feel. Users can open the application while surfing the Internet and through the Tweets on the Share function bring up an overlay which shows and lets users interact with Twitter relevant to the URL the user is on. TTAGIT turns any URL into its own sound board.</p>

<p>The Desktop extensions let users interact with Twitter relevant to any URL by using the browsers use of extensions and add-ons on <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/safari/">Safari</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>.</p>
	
<p>At this point, the only way to use TTAGIT on mobile is with Apple's IOS, but there may be further developments on other platforms as other platforms catch up to web standards.</p>
