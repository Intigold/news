<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vancouver, BC, April 21, 2015, </span>Intigold Mines Ltd.(<a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IGD.V">IGD - TSX-V</a>)  announces that the Company will hold its 2015 Annual and Special Meeting (the "Meeting") in Vancouver, B.C. as follows:</p>

<p>Meeting Date: Wednesday, June 10, 2015</p>

<p>Meeting Time: 11:00 a.m. (Vancouver time)</p>

<p>Record Date: Friday, May 8, 2015</p>

<p>The Company also announces the approval by its board of directors (the "Board of Directors") of an advance notice policy (the "Policy") on April 17, 2015, which Policy, among other things includes a provision that requires advance notice to the Company in certain circumstances where nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors are made by shareholders of the Company.</p>

<p>Among other things, the Policy fixes a deadline by which holders of record of common shares of the Company must submit director nominations to the Company prior to any annual or special meeting of shareholders and sets forth the information that a shareholder must include in the notice to the Company for it to be valid.</p>
	
<p>In the case of an annual meeting of shareholders, notice to the Company must be made not less than 30 nor more than 65 days prior to the date of the annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is to be held on a date that is less than 50 days after the date on which the first public announcement of the date of the annual meeting was made, notice may be made not later than the close of business on the 10th day following such public announcement.</p>

<p>The Policy is effective as of the date it was approved, subject to confirmation and ratification by the shareholders. At the next meeting of shareholders of the Company, shareholders will be asked to confirm and ratify the advance notice policy by ordinary resolution. If the policy is not confirmed at the shareholders' meeting, it will be of no further force and terminate. The full text of the Policy will be available via SEDAR at <a href="https://sedar,com">www.sedar.com</a> or upon request by contacting the Company at (604) 669-4677.</p>
