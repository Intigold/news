<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vancouver, BC, June 23, 2015, </span>Intigold Mines Ltd. (<a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IGD.V">IGD - TSX-V</a>) (<a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=idmnf">OTC:IDMNF</a>) ("the Company"), announced that it has received the following update from TTAGIT Social Networks Inc. ("TTAGIT"). Intigold owns a 51% interest in TTAGIT.</p>

<p>TTAGIT has retained Cheng Wang to work on Phatpen as a Programming Consultant. Cheng Wang was the lead programmer on the TTAGIT social network. Cheng has over 10 years' software development experience including five years web development experience with Java/Spring/Lift/Scala, C/C++, iPhone/Object C, Flash/AS3 and HTML5/CSS/Javascript. In addition, he has experience in programming for gaming and Poker as well building Billing and Payment Systems.</p>

<p>TTAGIT has signed an agreement with <a href="http://www.quotemedia.com/">QuoteMedia</a> for use of TTAGIT's API for stock market data.</p>

<p>Phatpen will be built in three stages. The first stage, which is underway, is building a database with accurate companies on the exchange. The second stage is building a scraper to find company names or stock symbols on the page the application is open on to compare with the database. The third stage is to connect to E*trade's API to allow trades on the companies found and compared with the database.</p>

<p>TTAGIT is also making ground with the last major pieces on the TTAGIT system. An embed button is coming along with some User Interface changes for the Mobile.</p>

<p><strong><em>TTAGIT - Technology</em></strong></p>
