<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vancouver, BC, July 29, 2015, </span>Intigold Mines Ltd. (<a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IGD.V">IGD - TSX-V</a>) announced that it has received the following update from TTAGIT Social Networks Inc. ("TTAGIT"). Intigold owns a 51% interest in TTAGIT.</p>

<p>TTAGIT is working on stage three of the Phatpen development, working with API's from Questrade and Quote Stream. TTAGIT is also catching up the mobile extension to its Chrome extension by adding Facebook and sentiments to it, as well as, catching up Safari and working on an embed button which should be complete soon.</p>

<p>The new TTAGIT website has been made and will be uploaded once the embed has been tested and ready. The embed allows users to add a TTAGIT button to their websites that will open up a window when clicked showing the Tweets and Facebook posts on that particular URL. This also eliminates the need for a comment system on websites and keeps the website clean looking.</p>

<p>Development is on schedule and we look forward to additional advancements.</p>

<p><em><strong>TTAGIT - Technology</strong></em></p>

<p>TTAGIT is a proprietary technology which allows Internet users to comment, talk and respond over any website (URL) using live feed. By using TTAGIT, users can stay on a webpage and post to their favorite social networks, without ever going to different website's to view or post comments. This is what gives TTAGIT its competitive advantage.</p>
