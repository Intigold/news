<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NEWS RELEASE</strong></span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vancouver, BC, October 01, 2015, </span>Intigold Mines Ltd. (<a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IGD.V">IGD - TSX-V</a>) announced that it has received the following update from TTAGIT Social Networks Inc. ("TTAGIT"). Intigold owns a 51% interest in TTAGIT.</p>

<p>TTAGIT has launched a new website that contains updates made to the TTAGIT system. TTAGIT has also made a embeddable version that users can embed on their own websites to track social activity and sentiments. By adding the embeddable version, TTAGIT has entered into the realm that applications such as Intense Debate, Disqus, Livefyre, and Facebook comments dominate</p>

<p>The TTAGIT embed will have an embeddable button that can be placed on webpages to allow users to use TTAGIT in an iframe that opens when the TTAGIT button is clicked. Because the button is an iframe, it is also unique from any other Social Button that shares. The TTAGIT button is not about sharing but about seeing what has been shared on the link. The TTAGIT button also acts as a unique way to comment and interact with people who are related to the content of the link semantically. TTAGIT is the ultimate sharing button as it also displays what has been shared on the link by Twitter or Facebook publicly.</p>

<p>Along with these updates TTAGIT has rebranded with a new logo and a new look. In addition, the other extensions are being rebranded as well</p>

<p><em><strong>Phatpen - Update</strong></em></p>

<p>Phatpen is in the final stage before being submitted into the first review in itunes before it can be tested internally and externally. The User Interface is being added right now, we are finishing wireframing and then the application will be submitted to itunes shortly and edited in the testing stages before being published at the itunes store. We will have news shortly on anymore updates on Phatpen which are coming soon.</p>

<p><em><strong>TTAGIT - Technology</strong></em></p>

<p>TTAGIT is a proprietary technology which allows Internet users to comment, talk and respond over any website (URL) using live feed. By using TTAGIT, users can stay on a webpage and post to their favorite social networks, without ever going to different website's to view or post comments. This is what gives TTAGIT its competitive advantage.</p>
