<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vancouver, BC, January 28, 2016, </span>Intigold Mines Ltd. (<a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IGD.V">IGD - TSX-V</a>) (OTC:<a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=idmnf">IDMNF</a> announced that it has received the following update from TTAGIT Social Networks Inc. ("TTAGIT"). Intigold owns a 51% interest in TTAGIT.</p>

<p><strong>TTAGIT Update</strong></p>

<p>TTAGIT has completed the final updates and branding for TTAGIT and it is ready for the market. The mobile update passed the code testing part for Apple and is available in the Apple Store for download on IOS devices (iPhone, iPad).</p>

<p>The TTAGIT Chrome extension has been fully updated and rebranded. Small usability fixes have been made as well as complete rebranding and updates to the API ("Application Programming Interface"). You can find the extension here: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ttagit/ijabkockaflfmmcfcpfacclaagfiippe?hl=en">Chrome Store</a></p>

<p>The TTAGIT Safari extension has also been rebranded and updated. Presently, the Safari extension can be downloaded from TTAGIT's new website at <a href="http://ttagit.com">ttagit.com</a></p>

<p>The TTAGIT Embed button has also been rebranded and updated and can be found on TTAGIT's new website.</p>

<p>Sentiment analysis has been removed as it was confusing to the simplification of TTAGIT. The removal of Sentiment Analysis was needed to keep the application marketable amongst a larger portion of majors. Sentiment analysis will be rolled out on the Phatpen application as a stock predictive engine.</p>

<p>We are just finishing off a how-to video that will be added to the website shortly.</p>

<p>We are very pleased with the updates and rebranding which will enable TTAGIT to market its products effectively to companies interested in the application.</p>

<p><strong>TTAGIT - Strategic Alliance Agreement</strong></p>

<p>TTAGIT and Catherine Schuller Enterprises, LLC of New York ("CSE") have entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement (the "Agreement") whereby the TTAGIT Platform will be used to bring exposure and potential revenue to CSE and its affiliates, "Runway the Real Way" and "Catwalk Click Thru". TTAGIT and CSE believe that it is mutually advantageous to share knowledge and cooperate with their respective marketing and sales efforts relating to their products and services, and to jointly pursue client opportunities.</p>

<p>Under the terms of the Agreement, CSE will use the TTAGIT Platform as a commenting system to generate exposure, feedback and traffic for its products, services and events. CSE will receive 60% of the gross revenues, TTAGIT will receive 35% and Jeff Ruskowsky will receive 5% of the gross revenues generated from the coordinated efforts of the CSE and TTAGIT Alliance.</p>

<p>CSE is a production and promotion entity which creates and markets events, shows, functions, gatherings and all manners of social networking platforms under the umbrella of fashion and related industries serving the markets associated with apparel, accessories, beauty, image and style. CSE is the creator and owner of Runway the Real Way, a fashion entity based on diversity of age, size, shape, height, gender, ethnicity, nationality and persuasion featuring the concepts of integration and inclusivity. CSE is also the creator of Catwalk Click Thru, a fashion show shopping app that allows for real time e-commerce at fashion events (and even pre- and post- show purchasing) providing the designers, vendors and manufacturers the ability to sell their products and services thru mobile devices that attendees already have in front of them at all times. It would interface with TTAGIT in that it would be a website that allows users to post to their favorite social network, recommend, interact and engage with content (items in the fashion shows) loaded up on Catwalk Click Thru on a page featuring the event's items available for purchase.</p>

<p><strong>TTAGIT - Technology</strong></p>

<p>TTAGIT is a proprietary technology which allows Internet users to comment, talk and respond over any website (URL) using live feed. By using TTAGIT, users can stay on a webpage and post to their favorite social networks, without ever going to different website's to view or post comments. This is what gives TTAGIT its competitive advantage.</p>
