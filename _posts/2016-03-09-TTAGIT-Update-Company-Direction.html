<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NEWS RELEASE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">INTIGOLD MINES LTD. - TTAGIT Update – Company Direction</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vancouver, BC, March 9, 2016, </span>Intigold Mines Ltd. (<a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IGD.V">IGD - TSX-V</a>) (OTC:<a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=idmnf">IDMNF</a>, - News) announced that it has received the following update from TTAGIT Social Networks Inc. ("TTAGIT"). Intigold owns a 51% interest in TTAGIT.</p>

<p><em><strong>TTAGIT Update</strong></em></p>

<p>“In building out TTAGIT to use mostly Javascript dependencies, we recognize that it is in TTAGIT’s best interests to build out a TTAGIT browser that is unique to all other browsers. With modern frameworks available for developments, this venture is not only easy but inexpensive.</p>

<p>The TTAGIT browser wouldn’t play by normal browser rules. The TTAGIT browser will behave more like a social network feed focusing on social networks, and will have commenting and TTAGIT built into the browser for webpages. Depending on what accounts a user has connected, he can also interact with the social network search contents. In addition, the TTAGIT browser will utilize the Google Search Application Programming Interface (“API”) so you get the best of Google Search as well.</p>

<p>The majority of browsers are held to older standards of web browsing (for example, just using the browser to find websites to buy from, for directions, etc.), while nowadays many people just get their news and recent pop culture from their social networks.  The TTAGIT browser isn’t meant to replace search engines but to enhance a user’s browsing experience into a more familiar feed much like a social network.  The TTAGIT browser will be the <em><strong>“Browser of Social Networking”</strong></em>.</p>

<p>This system will allow TTAGIT to utilize browser interaction to the fullest, and is an obvious direction for the company to go in as TTAGIT would be built right into the browser, and the browser would interact with social networks to bring a user a more modern way of browsing and one that users are familiar with.</p>

<p>TTAGIT already has a head start in codebase by its continuing development of feeds and API outreach. TTAGIT will be using cutting-edge Javascript frameworks to build out a “first of its kind” browser in IOS and Windows that would fully complete TTAGIT as a product that could contend with major competitors.”</p>

<p><em><strong>TTAGIT – Technology</strong></em></p>

<p>TTAGIT is a proprietary technology which allows Internet users to comment, talk and respond over any website (URL) using live feed.  By using TTAGIT, users can stay on a webpage and post to their favorite social networks, without ever going to different website's to view or post comments. This is what gives TTAGIT its competitive advantage.</p>
