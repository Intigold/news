<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NEWS RELEASE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">INTIGOLD MINES LTD. - TTAGIT Update</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vancouver, BC, April 21, 2016, </span>Intigold Mines Ltd. (<a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IGD.V">IGD - TSX-V</a>) (OTC:<a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=idmnf">IDMNF</a>, - News) announced that it has received the following update from TTAGIT Social Networks Inc. ("TTAGIT"). Intigold owns a 51% interest in TTAGIT.</p>

<p><em><strong>TTAGIT Update</strong></em></p>

<p>TTAGIT is compiling all the scripts for its technology into one master script so as to offer out an API (Application Programming Interface). This will allow TTAGIT to not only port out to more platforms but also for Strategic Business Partnerships to make use of each other within the application. This process will be short, and the cleaned script will be replacing the platforms that are already available. The first stage is releasing it on iPhone which will be coming soon. Also, the new script will be usable on Android. We will push that to the Android store if we see interest in it.</p>

<p><em><strong>TTAGIT – Technology</strong></em></p>

<p>TTAGIT is a proprietary technology which allows Internet users to comment, talk and respond over any website (URL) using live feed.  By using TTAGIT, users can stay on a webpage and post to their favorite social networks, without ever going to different website's to view or post comments. This is what gives TTAGIT its competitive advantage.</p>
