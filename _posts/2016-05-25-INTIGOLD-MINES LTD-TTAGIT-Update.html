<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">INTIGOLD MINES LTD. - TTAGIT Update</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vancouver, BC, May 25, 2016, </span>Intigold Mines Ltd. (<a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IGD.V">IGD - TSX-V</a>) (OTC:<a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=idmnf">IDMNF</a>, - News) announced that it has received the following update from TTAGIT Social Networks Inc. ("TTAGIT"). Intigold owns a 51% interest in TTAGIT.</p>

<p><em><strong>TTAGIT Update</strong></em></p>

<p>TTAGIT has compiled all the scripts for its technology into one master script that will be used for all of the extensions. This completed master script is responsive so it re-sizes for whatever device or window it will be displayed in. The master script enables TTAGIT to offer out an API (Application Programming Interface) which will allow TTAGIT to port out to more platforms and also allow for Strategic Business Partnerships to make use of each other within the application.</p>

<p>The IOS app has been submitted for review to the Apple Store. It will be available in the Apple Store for download on IOS devices (iPhone,iPad) once the review is complete.</p>

<p>The next processes (desktop, embed) will be quick as the hardest part is already done. Most of the time will be spent on the review process from Apple, Firefox, Google, etc.</p>

<p>The new script can be tested out at <a href="http://ttagit.ca/">http://ttagit.ca/</a></p>

<p>To see how it looks when over a URL, login to TTAGIT and go to <a href="http://ttagit.ca/#/tab/dash?search=cnn.com">http://ttagit.ca/#/tab/dash?search=cnn.com</a> where you can explore the feed.</p>

<p><em><strong>TTAGIT – Technology</strong></em></p>

<p>TTAGIT is a proprietary technology which allows Internet users to comment, talk and respond over any website (URL) using live feed.  By using TTAGIT, users can stay on a webpage and post to their favorite social networks, without ever going to different website's to view or post comments.
