<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NEWS RELEASE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>INTIGOLD MINES LTD.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Convertible Debenture Financing and Investor Relations Policy</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vancouver, BC, September 22, 2016, </span>Intigold Mines Ltd. (<a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IGD.V">IGD - TSX-V</a>) (OTC:<a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=idmnf">IDMNF</a>, - News) announces the following:</p>

<p><em><strong>Convertible Debenture Financing</strong></em></p>

<p>The Company has arranged a $200,000 convertible debenture private placement (the “<strong>Financing</strong>”), the proceeds of which will be used for general working capital purposes. The Financing is subject to acceptance by the TSX Venture Exchange (the “<strong>Exchange</strong>”).</p>

<p>Under the Financing, the Company proposes to issue up to $200,000 in total principal of unsecured transferable convertible debentures (the “<strong>Debentures</strong>”) of the Company.</p>

<p>The Debentures will mature two years from the date of issuance and bear interest at a rate of 12% per annum paid annually in arrears.</p>

<p>Pursuant to the terms of the Debentures, and subject to adjustment, the subscribers may, for a period of two years after the date the Debenture is issued, convert all or any part of: (i) the principal amount outstanding under the Debentures into units of the Issuer (each a “<strong>Unit</strong>”) at a price of $0.05 per Unit; and/or (ii) subject to Exchange acceptance, the interest that has accrued on the principal amount outstanding under the Debentures into Units at a price per Unit which equals the ‘Market Price’(as that term is set out in the policies of the Exchange), but not less than $0.15, at the time the accrued interest becomes payable: and/or (iii) if the Market Price of the Issuers shares trade above $0.25 for ten consecutive days, then the Issuer may force the holder of the Debentures to convert its principle and accrued interest into Units at a price of $0.25 per Unit.</p>

<p>Each Unit will be comprised of one common share in the capital of the Issuer (a “<strong>Unit Share</strong>”) and one half transferable common share purchase warrant of the Issuer (a “<strong>Warrant</strong>”). Each whole Warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase one additional post-consolidated common share of the Issuer (a “<strong>Warrant Share</strong>”) at any time on or before 4:00 p.m. (Vancouver time) on the date that is two (2) years from the date of issuance of the Debenture at an exercise price of $0.15 per Warrant Share, subject to adjustment in certain events.</p>

<p>All securities issued pursuant to the Financing will be subject to a four-month hold period.</p>

<p><em><strong>Investor Relations Policy</strong></em></p>

<p>The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted an Investor Relations Policy. This policy will be filed on SEDAR and posted on the Company’s website shortly.</p>
